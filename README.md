## Background
My name is Rawan, and I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I have a solid foundation in Deep Learning and Remote Sensing data, which I am eager to apply to real-world challenges. My passion lies in bridging the gap between research and practical coding, and I am excited to contribute to open-source projects through Google Summer of Code. This is my first experience with GSoC, and I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to collaborate with the global developer community and enhance my skills in a meaningful way.
